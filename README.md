This repo mostly exists for my personal backup and re-use, but could serve as a how-to for Rocket.rs, I guess?

If you want to try and run it yourself, make a copy of `Rocket.example.toml` as `Rocket.toml`, and `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit the values within, I left comments to cover what they do if not explicit.

Author note: this likely isn't very good, but I'm still learning.
